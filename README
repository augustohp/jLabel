jLabel is a very simple jQuery plugin that takes a label for an input, and makes it the value of the input.

* Example of markup
It takes this:
<label for="name">Full Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" value="" />

Into this:
<input type="text" id="name" value="Full Name" />

It works like expected - at least, the way i do. On the focus of the input, the label is out, and on blur if there is no content in the input, the label is put back as value of it.
