jLabel - <augusto [at] phpsp [dot] org [dot] br>

jLabel is a very simple jQuery plugin that takes a label for an input, and 
makes it the value of the input. You are free to use and modify it. Just let
me know if you miss a feature or find a bug.

* Example of markup
It takes this:
<label for="name">Full Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" value="" />

Into this:
<input type="text" id="name" value="Full Name" />

It works like expected - at least, the way i do. On the focus of the input, 
the label is out, and on blur if there is no content in the input, the label 
is put back as value of it.
